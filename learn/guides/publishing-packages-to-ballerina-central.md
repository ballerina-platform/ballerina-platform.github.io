## Creating a Library Package

Execute the `bal new -t lib` command to create a new library package.

```bash
bal new hello --template lib
```

This will create a new Ballerina package with a `hello` function. The `bal new` command generates the below for a library package:

```bash
cd hello
tree .
hello
    ├── Ballerina.toml 
    ├── hello.bal
    └── Package.md

0 directories, 3 files
```

It creates the `Ballerina.toml` file. Apart from it, the `hello.bal` source file and the [Package.md](/learn/organizing-ballerina-code/package-layout/#packagemd) files are created. For more information on these, see [Package Layout](/learn/organizing-ballerina-code/package-layout/).

The `Ballerina.toml` file will include the content below.

```toml
[package]
org = "user"
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"

[build-options]
observabilityIncluded = true
```

Execute the `bal build -c` to build the Ballerina archive of the package.

```bash
bal build -c
Compiling source
	user/hello:0.1.0

Creating bala
	target/bala/user-hello-any-0.1.0.bala
```

## Publishing a Library Package to Ballerina Central

Now, that you have a package to share with others, it can be published to the [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/). 

Ensure the package works as intended because a publish is **permanent**. Once published to Ballerina Central, the version can never be overwritten and the package cannot be removed. However, the number of versions of a package that can be pushed to Ballerina Central is not restricted.

>**Tip:** As a precaution, use the [local repository](/learn/managing-dependencies/#overriding-dependencies) first to test out the functionality of the library package before publishing it to Ballerina Central.


### Preparing for Publishing

1. Create an account on Ballerina Central. To register, [visit the home page](https://central.ballerina.io) and log in via a Google or GitHub account.

2. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard) and acquire an access token.

3. Download and place the `Settings.toml` file in your home repository (`<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/`). If you already have a `Settings.toml` file configured in your home repository, follow the other option and copy the access token into the `Settings.toml`. Else, if you are connected to the internet via an HTTP proxy, add the following section to `Settings.toml` and change accordingly.

```toml
[proxy]
host = "localhost"
port = "3128"
username = ""
password = ""
```

### Organizations

When you push a package to Ballerina Central, the organizations are validated against the value of the `org` field defined in the [Ballerina.toml](/learn/organizing-ballerina-code/package-layout/#ballerinatoml) file. Therefore, when you have more than one organizations in Ballerina Central, pick the organization name that you intend to push the package into, set that as the `org` in the `Ballerina.toml` file inside the package directory, and rebuild the package.

Also, organization names starting with `ballerina` (e.g., `ballerina`, `ballerinax`, `ballerinai`, etc.) are reserved for system use, and thereby, you cannot publish any packages starting with the `ballerina` prefix to Ballerina Central. Therefore, if you have used a name pattern matching this, update the `Ballerina.toml` and rebuild the package.

### Publishing the Package

Now, that you are ready to publish, execute the command below to publish the package to Ballerina Central.

```bash
bal push
```

## Using the Packages in Ballerina Central

After publishing your first package, you can create a second package and use the already-published package in it.

Any package published in Ballerina Central is public and they can be used in packages as explained in [Dependencies](/learn/managing-dependencies/).
